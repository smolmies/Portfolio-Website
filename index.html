                <p>I'm Michelle Curfs, currently 25 years old and I am Dutch.  </p> 
                <p>After highschool I have been looking for my next big step, having tried some different educations that didn't work out for me. I started to work in retail to fill up the space, get work experience and kept searching for a new path.<br />
                After recommendations from friends and my partner I started a bootcamp for Fullstack Software Developer in the end of 2020 and completed it with a certificate in the beginning of 2021.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I like to play <span id="ffxiv">Final Fantasy XIV</span> with friends, cuddle (a.k.a lovingly annoy) my 2 cats and partner and watch some streamers or anime. <br />
                    From time to time I like to dive into my more hands-on creative hobbies such as drawing, painting etc.</p>
